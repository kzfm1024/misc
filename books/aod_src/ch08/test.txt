In this chapter we set out some basic principles of debugging, both
general and also with regard to the GDB and DDD debuggers. At least one
of our ``rules'' will be formal in nature, The Fundamental Principle of
Debugging.


Beginners should of course read this chapter carefully, since the
material here will be used throughout the remainder of the book.

Professionals may be tempted to skip the chapter. We suggest, though,
that they at least skim through it. Many professionals will find at
least some new material, and in any case it is important that all
readers begin with a common background.
